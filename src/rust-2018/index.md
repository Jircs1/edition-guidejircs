# Rust 2018

The edition system was created for the release of Rust 2018. The release of the Rust 2018 edition coincided with a number of other features all coordinated around the theme of *productivity*. The majority of those features were backwards compatible and are now available on all editions; however, some of those changes required the edition mechanism (most notably the [module system changes](path-changes.md)).
