# Additions to the prelude

## Summary

- `TryInto`, `TryFrom` and `FromIterator` are now part of the prelude.
- This might change the meaning of e.g. `x.try_into()` depending on types and imports.

## Details

The [prelude of the standard library](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/prelude/index.html)
is the module containing everything that is automatically imported in every module.
It contains commonly used items such as `Option`, `Vec`, `drop`, and `Clone`.

The Rust compiler prioritizes any manually imported items over those
from the prelude, to make sure additions to the prelude will not break any existing code.
For example, if you have a crate or module called `example` containing a `pub struct Option;`,
then `use example::*;` will make `Option` unambiguously refer to the one from `example`;
not the one from the standard library.

However, adding a *trait* to the prelude can break existing code in a subtle way.
A call to `x.try_into()` using a `MyTryInto` trait might become ambiguous and
fail to compile if `std`'s `TryInto` is also imported,
since it provides a method with the same name.
This is the reason we haven't added `TryInto` to the prelude yet,
since there is a lot of code that would break this way.

As a solution, Rust 2021 will use a new prelude.
It's identical to the current one, except for three new additions:

- [`std::convert::TryInto`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/convert/trait.TryInto.html)
- [`std::convert::TryFrom`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/convert/trait.TryFrom.html)
- [`std::iter::FromIterator`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/iter/trait.FromIterator.html)

## Migration

As a part of the 2021 edition a migration lint, `rust_2021_prelude_collisions`, has been added in order to aid in automatic migration of Rust 2018 codebases to Rust 2021.

In order to have rustfix migrate your code to be Rust 2021 Edition compatible, run:

```
cargo fix --edition
```

### Implementation Reference

The lint needs to take a couple of factors into account when determining whether or not introducing 2021 Edition to a codebase will cause a name resolution collision (thus breaking the code after changing edition). These factors include:

- Is the call a [fully-qualified call] or does it use [dot-call method syntax]?
  - This will affect how the name is resolved due to auto-reference and auto-dereferencing on method call syntax. Manually dereferencing/referencing will allow specifying priority in the case of dot-call method syntax, while fully-qualified call requires specification of the type and the trait name in the method path (e.g. `<Type as Trait>::method`)
- Is this an [inherent method] or [a trait method]?
  - Inherent methods that take `self` will take priority over `TryInto::try_into` as inherent methods take priority over trait methods, but inherent methods that take `&self` or `&mut self` won't take priority due to requiring a auto-reference (while `TryInto::try_into` does not, as it takes `self`)
- Is the origin of this method from `core`/`std`? (As the traits can't have a collision with themselves)
- Does the given type implement the trait it could have a collision against?
- Is the method being called via dynamic dispatch? (i.e. is the `self` type `dyn Trait`)
  - If so, trait imports don't affect resolution, and no migration lint needs to occur
